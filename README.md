# PROJECT-TABLEAU-PUBLIC-DASHBOARD
Data Analysis and Data Visualization Project, through the creation of dashboards, using the Tableau tool.

## 📊 Analysis of European Ski Resorts with Tableau Public
### 🚀 Project Overview
This project analyzes key characteristics of European ski resorts using Tableau Public. The goal is to explore and visualize the data to identify trends such as resort altitude, number of slopes, lift prices, and the geographical distribution of ski areas.

### 📂 Repository Contents
- Main_Datas_of_Ski_Resorts_by_European_Country.twbx – 1st Tableau workbook containing the interactive dashboards.
- Data_exploration_by_European_Country.twbx – 2nd Tableau workbook containing the interactive dashboards.
- Main_European_Country.twbx – 3rd Tableau workbook containing the interactive dashboards.
- Main_Resort.twbx – 4th Tableau workbook containing the interactive dashboards.
- European_Ski_Resorts.csv – Source dataset used for the analysis.
- README.md – Project description and insights.

### 📌 Dataset Information
The data comes from this Kaggle:
- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thomasnibb/european-ski-resorts?utm_source=chatgpt.com

It includes the following attributes:

📍 Location – Country of ski resorts in Europe.

🎿 Infrastructure – Total number of slopes, snow canons, chair lifts, gondola lifts, total ski area (in km), the presence of a snowpark or not and 
the eventual possibility of night ski.

⛷️ Slope Difficulty – Total number of beginner,intermediate and difficult slopes.

💰 Pricing – Daily adult ski pass prices in resort.

❄️ Altitude – Minimum and maximum resort altitudes.

### 📊 Dashboards & Analysis
I created multiple dashboards to explore different aspects of the data:

#### Ski Resort Overview in European Country 🌍
Interactive map with filters for country and altitude.

Key indicators (total number of resorts by country, total number of slopes by country, total number of lifts by country, etc.).

Questions answered : Which are the main European countries, for ski resorts ? in number of resorts ? slopes ? lifts ? snow canons ?

#### Resort Infrastructure Comparison ⛷️
Analysis of daily pass prices, based on resort infrastructure.

Ranking of the largest ski resorts in Europe, by number of snow canons, lifts, slopes, the lift capacity, the max and min altituds
and also the daily skipass price for adult.

Questions answered : Which are the main European ski resorts, for ski Resorts ? in number of infrastructures as slopes, lifts, snow canons or altituds ?
Is the number of snow cannons related to the altitude of the resort?

#### Slope Difficulty Analysis 🎯
Distribution of slopes by difficulty level and comparision with the resorts altituds.
Comparison of difficulty levels across countries.
